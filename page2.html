    <h1>Instructions:</h1>
<h4><b>1. Prepare the Dough:</b></h4>
In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.
Mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.

<h4><b>2. Make the Pizza Sauce:</b></h4>
In a small bowl, mix together the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Adjust the seasonings to taste.

<h4><b>3. Preheat the Oven:</b></h4>
Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go, typically around 475°F to 500°F (245°C to 260°C).

<h4><b>4. Roll Out the Dough:</b></h4>
Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.

<h4><b>5. Assemble the Pizza:</b></h4>
Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza stone or a baking sheet.
Spread the pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.
Add your favorite toppings, including shredded mozzarella cheese.

<h4><b>6. Bake:</b></h4>
Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.

<h4><b>7. Serve:</b></h4>
Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve.
