    <h1>Instructions:</h1>
<h4><b>1. Prepare the Vegetables:</b></h4>

In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, carrots, celery, and garlic. Cook until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes.

<h4><b>2. Add Beans and Tomatoes:</b></h4>
Stir in the cannellini beans and diced tomatoes. Cook for another 5 minutes.

<h4><b>3. Add Greens and Other Vegetables:</b></h4>
Add the chopped kale or Swiss chard, shredded cabbage, diced zucchini, and potato to the pot. Stir well.

<h4><b>4. Pour in Broth:</b></h4>
Add the vegetable or chicken broth to the pot. If you have a Parmesan rind, add it for extra flavor. Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes if desired.

<h4><b>5. Simmer:</b></h4>
Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 30-40 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.

<h4><b>6.Add Bread:</b></h4>
Add the stale bread chunks to the pot and let them soak in the soup for about 10 minutes. Stir occasionally.

<h4><b>7.Serve:</b></h4>
Remove the Parmesan rind if used. Adjust the seasoning if needed. Ladle the Ribollita into bowls, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.
